The New York Times web site provides a rich set of APIs, as described here: http://developer.nytimes.com/docs Youâ€™ll need to start by signing up for an API key.
Your task is to choose one of the New York Times APIs, construct an interface in R to read in the JSON data, and transform it to an R dataframe.

url <- "http://api.nytimes.com/svc/books/v3/lists/overview.json?published_date=2017-01-01"
req <- fromJSON(paste0(url, API_key))
bestsellers <- req$results$list
